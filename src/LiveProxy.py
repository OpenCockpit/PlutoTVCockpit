    Both inputs are written to seekable temp files so ffmpeg can probe each
    stream's start_time and normalise output PTS.  When *audio_data* is None
    the single stream is re-muxed without explicit stream mapping.
    Falls back to returning the input data unchanged on any ffmpeg error.

    itsoffset is derived from the PTS difference between the two streams -
    it reflects whatever CDN-side alignment exists between them, typically
    near-zero for an ordinary window and up to the PTS span of one window
    at most for a genuine content transition.

    *v_pts*/*a_pts*, if given, are used directly instead of independently
    re-deriving them with _first_pts. Every current caller already knows
    both exactly - they came straight from _RenditionBuffer.cut()'s return
    when the slices being muxed here were cut - so scanning the same bytes
    a second time here would be pure waste. Left optional (falling back to
    _first_pts) so this function stays independently correct if ever called
    with bytes whose PTS isn't already known by the caller.

    When *state* is given, the real audio segment's sample rate/channel count
    is probed once and cached on state.audio_format so later silence-injected
    segments (see the *audio_data* is None branch below) match it instead of
    a hardcoded guess - switching the decoder between two different audio
    formats mid-stream is its own, separate source of playback trouble on top
    of whatever a real content transition already causes.

    -copyts preserves each stream's real absolute PTS/PCR instead of ffmpeg's
    default of rebasing every independent mux to start near zero - confirmed
    against real segment pairs that the underlying CDN timeline is already
    continuous across ordinary segment boundaries, so this alone is enough
    to stop PCR/PTS from resetting every ~5s. It does *not* touch continuity
    counters, which every fresh ffmpeg process still starts at 0 per PID
    regardless - that part is fixed separately below via _patch_continuity.

    *is_disc* controls whether this segment is flagged as a genuine content
    transition (-mpegts_flags initial_discontinuity, matching a real CDN
    #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY - the underlying encoder actually restarted, so a
    real PCR/PTS jump here is correct, not a bug) versus an ordinary segment
    that should carry on the previous one's timeline with no flag at all.
    This is the one flag consumers (GStreamer's hlsdemux for live, and
    RecordingProxy's _segment_is_disc/_continuize for recordings) ever see
    baked into the TS bytes - it must stay tied to a *real* transition only.

    *track_cc* opts this call into the shared per-channel CC continuation
    chain in state._cc_state, updating it for the next call. Only safe for
    the primary, strictly-in-order video-prefetch path: state._cc_state
    reflects "whatever the highest seq processed so far ended at", so a
    call that might land out of order relative to that (the late-audio
    upgrade overwriting an already-passed seq, or the disconnected
    synchronous fallback) must leave it False - they still get -copyts and
    an is_disc flag that accurately reflects whether their segment is a
    real transition, just not chained CC continuity.

    *reset_cc* controls only whether _patch_continuity restarts the CC chain
    at {} instead of continuing state._cc_state - defaults to *is_disc* (a
    real transition always needs a fresh CC baseline too) but can be set
    True independently of is_disc, for a segment whose *content* is
    continuous but whose CC baseline needs restarting for an unrelated
    bookkeeping reason (see state._cc_resync_pending). Deliberately a
    separate parameter from is_disc: forcing is_disc True to get a CC reset
    would also plant a false -mpegts_flags initial_discontinuity in that
    segment's bytes, telling GStreamer's hlsdemux (or RecordingProxy) a real
    content cut happened right there when it didn't.

    Replaces the old per-CDN-segment mux call in _video_prefetch_loop.
    Deliberately cuts by *CDN segment boundary*, not by a fixed target
    duration: an HLS video segment is guaranteed self-contained (its own
    SPS/PPS and a leading IDR/keyframe), which is exactly why the old
    per-segment design never had a decode problem on the video side in the
    first place. Cutting at an arbitrary fixed-duration PTS boundary
    instead (an earlier version of this function did exactly that) breaks
    that guarantee: a window frequently starts mid-GOP with no leading
    keyframe, and sometimes with no SPS/PPS NAL in range at all - confirmed
    in production as periodic video freezes (decoder has nothing
    displayable until the next real keyframe) and outright _ffmpeg_mux
    failures ("non-existing PPS 0 referenced", rc=234, 0 bytes output,
    silently falling back to video-only - the exact video_data-only path
    _ffmpeg_mux's docstring already flags as worse than the mismatch it
    exists to paper over). Cutting at CDN segment boundaries restores that
    guarantee while still sourcing audio from the continuous buffer for
    whatever exact PTS range this video segment covers - audio no longer
    needs to be a matching *discrete segment*, just a PTS-range slice,
    which is the actual fix the windowed-buffer redesign was for; nothing
    about that benefit depends on how video's own boundaries are chosen.

    state._video_buf/_video_cursor_pts are touched only by the video
    prefetch thread (this function is only ever called synchronously from
    that same thread), so - like state._cc_state - they need no lock of
    their own; only the state._ready_segs/_window_meta/_next_chunk_seq
    publish step below is shared with HTTP handler threads and
    _resolve_late_audio_window, and is locked accordingly.

    has no B-frames, so transmission order already equals display order)
    but not guaranteed for H.264 video with B-frames: a P-frame is
    transmitted before the B-frames that display earlier than it, so a
    video segment's own pts_offsets (as scanned by _scan_ts_index, in
    transmission order) can be locally out of order. Confirmed on real
    Pluto content via a diagnostic in _RenditionBuffer.append(): up to
    roughly half the PTS entries in a single segment out of order, on both
    live and VOD channels equally. bisect() on unsorted input doesn't
    raise - it silently returns a technically-computed but wrong index,
    slicing the wrong byte range. Only VOD is switched to this whole-
    segment path (see the call site in _video_prefetch_loop) rather than
    fixing _RenditionBuffer.cut() itself, to keep live TV's already-working
    code path completely untouched.

    None of this needs fixing in the first place for the common case this
    function actually handles: in steady state, _video_prefetch_loop calls
    this once per newly-fetched CDN segment, and an HLS segment is already
    self-contained (its own SPS/PPS + leading keyframe) - there is no
    reason to slice it out of a bigger buffer by PTS at all. Muxing it
    whole, exactly as fetched, sidesteps the bisect dependency entirely.

    *v_pts* and *v_end_pts* must be this segment's true min/max PTS
    (order-independent - see the B-frame reasoning above; the caller
    computes both via min()/max() over every entry in this segment's own
    pts_offsets), not an approximated span. An earlier version of this
    function derived v_end_pts as v_pts + one nominal seg_duration instead
    - which is exactly the kind of imprecision the windowed-buffer redesign
    (see _cut_and_mux_next_window's own docstring on why it replaced the
    old per-segment design's tolerance-based matching with exact PTS-range
    coverage) moved away from for good reason: a real CDN segment's true
    span is never exactly the nominal target duration, so that
    approximation systematically over- or under-covers the audio query by
    a small amount on *every* window. cut()'s exact-range matching still
    "succeeds" either way (over-coverage doesn't fail the match, it just
    slices more bytes), so nothing here ever shows up as a miss or a large
    per-window itsoffset - but over hundreds of windows in a long VOD
    title, a systematic few-millisecond-per-window bias compounds into a
    multi-second, steadily growing A/V offset that survives seeking
    (every window carries the same bias) and never self-corrects (nothing
    re-anchors to true content position - each window's own start is
    exact, via min(), but its end, and therefore how much of the *next*
    window's rightful audio bleeds into this one, was not). Using this
    segment's own true max() instead removes the systematic bias entirely.

    Mirrors _cut_and_mux_next_window's own audio-matching, muxing,
    publishing, provisional/late-audio-retry, and epoch-resync logic
    exactly (see that function's comments for the reasoning behind each),
    just operating on a whole fetched segment instead of a buffer slice.

    from the handler thread (safe to block) when the master playlist fetch fails
    with an empty JWT.  It must return a fresh master URL with a valid token, or
    None on failure.

    Idempotent for an already-registered channel_id: reuses its existing
    state (pre-fetch threads, audio ring, muxed-segment cache) and just
    refreshes master_url, rather than tearing it down and starting from
    scratch. This is what makes it safe for *any* caller to invoke freely
    for the same channel_id - live playback, a recording of the channel
    currently being watched, or a recording timer simply re-resolving the
    same service mid-recording - without disrupting an already-running
    stream. The previous version always replaced same-channel_id state on
    the theory that this only happens on a deliberate re-tune; in
    production a single recording's service reference got re-resolved a
    dozen times in 10 minutes with no live viewer involved at all, each
    call restarting the channel from scratch (fresh master/variant fetch,
    empty audio ring, epoch reset to 0) and audibly corrupting the
    recording. There is no actual caller that depends on a same-channel_id
    call forcing a restart - that's what close_channel() is for, explicitly.

    Different channel_ids never evict each other through this call, so
    independent concurrent channels (e.g. one being recorded while another
    is watched live) each keep their own pre-fetch threads undisturbed.
    Closing a channel nobody asked to replace is handled elsewhere: callers
    that track "the live slot" call close_channel() explicitly the moment
    they know it moved on (see PlutoTVRequest.playServiceExtension), and the
    idle reaper started alongside the HTTP server in start() is the backstop
    for anything that stops being read without ever calling back in here

        associated with any CDN URL to re-fetch from in the first place -

        all. _handle_playlist only ever advertises chunk_seqs already
